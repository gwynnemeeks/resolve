# RESOLVE

### Set your daily intention and reflect on your journey

This is a simple, single feature CRUD React app built for teaching purposes. It is the first tier of a three tier personal project. I plan on building the same app, three times, with a different front-end technologies (React, Vue, and Mint), all with the purpose of teaching myself and others how to use these tools.

This README will (hopefully) contain links to the commits with each feature. For the next few weeks to months, it is under construction.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
